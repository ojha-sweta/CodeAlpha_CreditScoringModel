## 📌 Project: Credit Scoring Model

### 🎯 Objective
The Credit Scoring Model predicts whether a financial transaction or user is safe or risky. It analyzes financial data to help identify potential fraud and support smarter credit risk assessment decisions.

---

### 📊 Dataset
This project uses a real-world credit transaction dataset containing:
• Time and transaction amount
• 28 anonymized financial features (V1–V28)
• Target Label → 0 = Legit | 1 = Fraud/Risk
